## Working with Rasa
Take some time to get familiar with the open-source Chatbot library, Rasa, by going through the [User Guide](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/installation/)

You will need to install Rasa using the following command:
```
$ pip3 install rasa-x --extra-index-url https://pypi.rasa.com/simple
```

Individual projects and assignments will be added as we solidify our project requirements over the coming week and will be announced on Discord as well as tracked via the GitHub "Projects" tab.
